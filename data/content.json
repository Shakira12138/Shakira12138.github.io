    " I am currently studying on the fusion of Large Language Models (LLMs).",
     "I am a Ph.D. Student at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, advised by Prof. <a href='https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~hongxyang/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Hongxia Yang</a>. My research is centered on enhancing the capabilities of AI systems, with a primary focus on Model over Models and Posttrain of LLMs.",
    " My previous research is mainly on AI security and interpretability, specifically, the backdoor defense in Deep Neural Networks based on image classification tasks."
